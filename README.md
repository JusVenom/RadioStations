A Batch file that lets the user choose a radio station to play using MusicBee Portable.

This is a .bat which i created to play A Variety of Radio Stations.

Customizable (Add/Edit/Remove Stations in StationList.bat or the .m3u/.pls Files)

Discreet (Starts in Mini Player View - A Small Box that Sits in Bottom Right Corner)

Extract the MusicBee.7z Archive.. Create a Shortcuut to.. Play-Radio-Stations.bat Anywhere..

Run The Shortcut, Press C and Choose a Station (or press nothing and it will load the last played station)

ONLY ON FIRST RUN Will it Prompt you to Locate the Library.. Just Hit Locate and Open.. MusicBee\Library\MusicBeeLibrary.mbl

Enjoy :)
